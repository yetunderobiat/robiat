    <h1>FOOD</h1>
    <p>Food is any <em>substance</em> consumed to provide nutritional support
        and energy to an organism. It can be raw, processed, or formulated
        and is consumed orally by animals for growth, health, or pleasure.
        Food is mainly composed of water(H<sub>2</sub>0), lipids, proteins, and carbohydrates. 
        Minerals (e.g., salts) and<b> organic substances</b> (e.g., vitamins) can also be
        found in food.Plants, algae, and some microorganisms use photosynthesis
        to make some of their own nutrients. Water is found in many foods and has
        been defined as a food by itself. Water and fiber have low energy densities,
        or calories, while fat is the most energy-dense component.Some inorganic
        (non-food) elements are also essential for plant and animal functioning.
        water was created in the 17<sup>th</sup> century.

    <h2 id="Sources of food">Sources of food</h2>
    <p>In a given ecosystem, food forms a web of <strong> interlocking
        chains</strong> with primary producers at the bottom and apex 
        predators at the top. Other aspects of the web include
        detrovores (that eat detritis) and decomposers 
        (that break down dead organisms).Primary producers include
        algae, plants, bacteria and protists that acquire their energy
        from sunlight. Primary consumers are the herbivores that consume
        the plants, and secondary consumers are the carnivores that consume 
        those herbivores. Some organisms, including most mammals and birds, 
        diet consists of both animals and plants, and they are considered 
        omnivores. The chain ends with the apex predators, the animals that 
        have no known predators in its ecosystem.Humans are considered apex predators.</p>

    <h3 id="Taste">Taste</h3>
    <p>Animals, specifically humans, typically have five
        different types of tastes: sweet, sour, salty, bitter, 
        and umami. The differing tastes are important for
        distinguishing between foods that are nutritionally 
        beneficial and those which may contain harmful toxins. 
        As animals have evolved, the tastes that provide the most
        energy are the most pleasant to eat while others are not 
        enjoyable, although humans in particular can acquire a 
        preference for some substances which are initially 
        unenjoyable.Water, while important for survival, has no taste.</p>
