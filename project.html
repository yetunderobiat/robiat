           <p> My name is <strong>Ibrahim Robiat Yetunde </strong>
              I turned 25 years old 27<sup>th</sup> of june and I am a software developer.

              I have a younger brother named Roqeeb. I have a group of friends at work
              and out of them Manvi is my best friend. She visits my house at 
              weekends and we play outdoor games together. I believe in her and I can share anything with her.</p>

              <p>Science and technology fascinate me so I took part in aninterschool science competition in which my team of 4 girls
                worked on a 3-D model of the earth representing past, present, and future. It took us a week to finish off the project and we 
                presented the model at Ghaziabad school. We werecompeting against 30 teams and we won the competition. </p>

              <p>I was confident and determined about the fact that we could win because my passion helped me give 
                my 100% input in the task. Though I have skills in certain subjects I donâ€™t have to excel in everything, 
                I struggle to perform well in mathematics. And to enhance my problem-solving skills I used to study maths 2 hours a day. </p>

              <p>I wanted to become a scientist, and being punctual and attentive are my characteristics as I 
                never arrive late for school. Generally, I do my work on my own so that I inculcate the value of being an 
                independent person. I always help other people when they are in difficult situations. 
                I reside in nigeria and one things that fascinates me about my culture is it art and culture</p>


                <h3><em>Arts and culture in nigeria</em></h3>	
                Nigerian versatility in art is so great that it is generally felt that all African nations should view 
                Nigeria as the principal trustee of the most durable fruits of black artistic genius. It is not precisely
                known when the first works of Nigerian art reached the outside world, but in 1897, following a British punitive 
                expedition to Benin, over 2,000 Benin bronzes and ivories were shipped to England and later dispersed all over Europe and America.
                At the National Museum in Lagos, works from all over the federation present a vivid picture of the national diversity 
                of arts and crafts. Today, the heritage and tradition of excellence in Nigeria arts continues and typified by the works of world renowned artists.

                <h3 id="culture">CULTURE</h3>
                In the humanities, one sense of culture as an attribute of the individual has been the degree to which they have cultivated a particular level of sophistication in 
                the arts, sciences, education, or manners. The level of cultural sophistication has also sometimes been used to distinguish civilizations from less complex societies. 
                Such hierarchical perspectives on culture are also found in class-based distinctions between a high culture of the social elite and a low culture, popular culture, or folk culture 
                of the lower classes, distinguished by the stratified access to cultural capital. In common parlance, culture is often used to refer specifically to the <em>symbolic</em> markers used by 
                ethnic groups to distinguish themselves visibly from each other such as body modification, clothing or jewelry. Mass culture refers to the mass-produced and mass mediated forms of consumer culture that 
                emerged in the 20th century. Some schools of philosophy, such as Marxism and critical theory, have argued that culture is often used politically as a tool of the elites to manipulate the proletariat 
                and create a false consciousness. Such perspectives are common in the discipline of cultural studies. In the wider social sciences, the theoretical perspective of cultural materialism holds that human 
                symbolic culture arises from the material conditions of human life, as humans create the conditions for physical survival, and that the basis of culture is found in evolved biological dispositions.

                    <h4 id="nok">Nok Culture</h4>
                      Evidence shows the Nok people had knowledge of iron smelting and adorned themselves with tin and stone beads, earrings, nose rings 
                      and bracelets. The Nok Culture is dated between 500 B.C. and 200 A.D.

                          <li>Middle Nok Period ceramics</li>
                          <li>Late Nok Period ceramics</li>

                    <h4 id="brass">Brass or bronze</h4>
                      Casting is still done but there is nothing produced now to compare with the fabulous Ife and Benin Bronzes. These perfect examples of portraiture and 
                      the "cire perdue" method of casting, together with the equally perfect terracotta, thought to be of the same period and possibly by the same 
                      craftsmen, have no equals anywhere.

                    <h4 id="grass">Grass Weaving</h4>
                      As grass is plentiful in the northern parts of Nigeria, northern craftsmen and women make grass baskets, fans, tables and floor mats. Some of the objects are beautifully coloured and durable.

       <h3>FESTIVALS</h3>
            Festivals in Nigeria, some of which dates back to the period before the arrival of the major religions in her ethnically and culturally diverse society. The Christian festivals and Islam festivals are often celebrated in ways that are unique to Nigeria or unique to the people of a locality. The Nigerian Tourism Development Corporation has been working with the states to bring more awareness and significance to the traditional festivals, which may become important sources of tourism revenue. There are more than <b>365</b> festivals in Nigeria according to the Minister of Information and Culture, <b>Mr Lai Mohammed</b> and government is working hard to harness these festivals as a way of showcasing and boosting the country's diverse cultures

      <h2>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A LINE ELEMENT AND A BLOCK ELEMENT</h2>
        <strong>Block Elements:</strong>Block elements are HTML elements that typically start on a 
        new line and occupy the full width available.Some examples of block elements are <em>div, header, p, section, ul, h1 </em> and so on.<p></p>

        <strong>Line elements:</strong>line elements do not start on a new line and only occupy as much width as necessary. These elements are 
        displayed inline, allowing other elements to sit beside them on the same line.Some examples of line elements are <em>em, a, strong, span</em> and so on.
