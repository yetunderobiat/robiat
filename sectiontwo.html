    <h1>The human brain</h1>
    <p>The brain is the central organ of the human nervous system,
        and with the spinal cord makes up the central nervous system. 
        The brain consists of the cerebrum, the brainstem and the cerebellum. 
        It controls most of the activities of the body, processing, 
        integrating, and coordinating the information it receives 
        from the sense organs, and making decisions as to the instructions 
        sent to the rest of the body. The brain is contained in, 
        and protected by, the skull bones of the head.</p>

    <h2>Cerebellum</h2>
    <p>The cerebellum is divided into an anterior lobe, a posterior lobe,
        and the flocculonodular lobe.The anterior and posterior 
        lobes are connected in the middle by the vermis. 
        Compared to the cerebral cortex, the cerebellum has a much
        thinner outer cortex that is narrowly furrowed into numerous 
        curved transverse fissures. Viewed from underneath between the 
        two lobes is the third lobe the flocculonodular lobe. The cerebellum 
        rests at the back of the cranial cavity, lying beneath the occipital 
        lobes, and is separated from these by the cerebellar tentorium, a sheet of fibre.</p>

    <h3>Brainstem</h3>
    <p>The brainstem lies beneath the cerebrum and consists 
        of the midbrain, pons and medulla. It lies in the back 
        part of the skull, resting on the part of the base known as 
        the clivus, and ends at the foramen magnum, a large opening 
        in the occipital bone. The brainstem continues below this 
        as the spinal cord,protected by the vertebral column.</p>
