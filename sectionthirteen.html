        <h1>Solar System</h1>
        
        
        <p>The Solar System is the gravitationally bound system of the Sun and the objects that orbit it.
            It was formed about 4.6 billion years ago when a dense region of a molecular cloud collapsed, 
            forming the Sun and a protoplanetary disc. The Sun is a typical star that maintains a balanced 
            equilibrium by the fusion of hydrogen into helium at its core, releasing this energy from its outer 
            photosphere. Astronomers classify it as a G-type main-sequence star.
            The largest objects that orbit the Sun are <span class="span">the eight planets</span>. In order from the Sun, they are 
            <span class="span">four terrestrial planets</span> (Mercury, Venus, Earth and Mars); <span class="span">two gas giants</span> 
            (Jupiter and Saturn); and <span class="span">two ice giants</span> (Uranus and Neptune). All terrestrial planets 
            have solid surfaces. Inversely, all giant planets do not have a definite surface, as they are mainly
            composed of gases and liquids. Over <span class="number">99.86%</span> of the Solar System's mass is in the
            Sun and nearly 90% of the remaining mass is in Jupiter and Saturn.</p>

    <h2 id="comp">Composition</h2>
     <p>The principal component of the Solar System is the Sun, a G-type main-sequence star 
     star that contains 99.86% of the system's known mass and dominates it gravitationally.
     The Sun's four largest orbiting bodies, the giant planets, account for 99% of the remaining mass, 
     with Jupiter and Saturn together comprising more than 90%. The remaining objects of the Solar System
     (including the four terrestrial planets, the dwarf planets, moons, asteroids, and comets) together
     comprise less than 0.002% of the Solar System's total mass.The Sun is composed of roughly 98% 
     hydrogen and helium, as are Jupiter and Saturn.A composition gradient exists in the Solar System,
     created by heat and light pressure from the early Sun; those objects closer to the Sun, which are 
     more affected by heat and light pressure, are composed of elements with high melting points. 
     Objects farther from the Sun are composed largely of materials with lower melting points.
     The boundary in the Solar System beyond which those volatile substances could coalesce is known 
     as the frost line, and it lies at roughly five times the Earth's distance from the Sun.</p>
