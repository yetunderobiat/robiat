            Fresh pasta isn't something to master in one go. 
            It takes time and practice, but it yields dividends. 
            This particular recipe is vastly versatile. It can be
            made into whole grain pasta, by swapping in 1 cup sifted 
            whole wheat, spelt or farro flour in place of 1 cup all-purpose 
            or flour. Add more egg yolks or water as needed and rest the 
            dough for 1 hour. Or try a green pasta, as in this ravioli 
            verdi: Steam or sauté 6 ounces baby spinach (about 6 cups) until just wilted.
            Spread it out on a parchment-lined baking sheet, and, when 
            cool, squeeze water out thoroughly, a handful at a time, 
            then chop roughly. Purée with 2 eggs and 1 egg yolk, then 
            use this mixture in place of eggs in the recipe. Or, for 
            something a little different, make an herbed pasta, like 
            this pappardelle, by stirring in cup finely chopped parsley, 
            chives, chervil, tarragon, or basil in any combination to 
            the eggs before adding to the flour in the main recipe.
